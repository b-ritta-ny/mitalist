## Description

This project is for those who enjoy Japanese anime, and would like a space where they can list all the shows they've watched and keep track of their favorites.

## Usage

A User signs up for an account on the website using their own username and password, which creates a record on our backend database. That information is saved in our sesssions, and a user is then logged in where they will be able to view features that are unavailable unless logged in. Users can navigate to the Anime List page, where they will see a list of anime they've logged that's being fetched from our backend database managed with Ruby on Rails. Each listing has an array of information about each anime, such as its title, studio, and a summary. Users may also favorite a anime for their own personal collection should they navigate to the favorites page.

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.7.4
- NodeJS (v16), and npm
- Heroku CLI
- Postgresql

## Roadmap 
For future updates on this application, an additional model added representing different studios that develop anime. This will allow the user to filer suggested anime, based on what studio they came from. A user will have more customization such as an avatar, as well as being able to change their password at will. Favorited anime will be able to be removed should a user choose to. Furthermore, a star rating system will be implemented.
